# Water_flow_sensor_MQTT
Water flow sensor based on WEMOS D1 Pro with a hall sensor

## The problem
Many block of flats in Mallorca have only one water mater. 
Obviously, not all residents consume the same amount of water.  
So the contribution to expenses is not fair.

## An idea deloyed
I have developed my own home automation architecture. The archetype for any sensor includes a microcontroller based on ESP8266
